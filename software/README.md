# Audio Playground library

1) Copy the audioplay folder to your Arduino libraries folder
2) Import the library and create an instance (s
3) Check the .h for pin shortcuts and enjoy!

## Roadmap

Add calibration function for both input and outputs, storing data in EEPROM.

Some kind of way to drive the LEDs nicer than just digital/analog writes (bi-colour, mixing etc)

Setup basics like bounce on buttons, pot scaling, etc
